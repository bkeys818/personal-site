# Meal Preping with ChatGPT

*Disclaimer - ChatGPT was used to improve the writing in the following article, but no changes to the content were made.*

Artificial intelligence (AI) is having a moment, and it’s anything but a fad. However, in my opinion, the technology we have right now isn’t all that impressive on its own. But used as a tool to work alongside you, it can be incredibly beneficial. If we start seeing professionals pushed out of the workforce, it won’t be by AI alone but by those who learn to use it in their workflow. That’s why I’m trying to integrate AI tools like Chat GPT more into my life.

Recently, I used Chat GPT to revise a cover letter, and I was blown away by the result. This time, I want to see how well it can generate content, not just revise it. So, I decided to try making a meal prep plan and grocery list using Chat GPT.

## **Meal Prep**

Since I’ve been trying to include more protein in my diet, I included that in my prompt.

> Make a meal prep plan that focuses on protein.

The response contained five days with different meals, but it included some foods I’m not fond of. So, I tried nudging the AI toward my taste by requesting it to not include tomatoes, squash, or avocado.

> Don’t include tomatoes and focus less of vegetables

> Don’t include squash or avocado

This swapped out some ingredients and changed some of the meals entirely. After the changes, I had the following.

## **Grocery List**

Happy with that response, I wanted to create a shopping list for all the necessary ingredients to make those meals.

> Create a grocery list for these meals, include quantities

Initially, I was pretty impressed by the response. ChatGPT sorted the ingredients into categories, and I didn’t even ask it to do that.

After looking closer, I noticed that some units don’t make much sense. How much is “1 container” of protein powder? That could mean anything. To be fair, if I’m asking for a protein-focused diet, having extra protein powder won’t be the biggest issue.

## **Overview**

We will undoubtedly face challenges as we continue integrating AI into our lives, but we’ll also achieve things we can only dream of. If you’re scared that robots will steal your job, take a deep breath and remember that AI still has limitations. It makes a better sidekick to humans than a replacement. At the same time, we need to proceed with caution. This is the worst AI will ever be, and it will only be more powerful from here out. I’m much more worried about what people with nefarious motives can do with AI than what it can do alone.
