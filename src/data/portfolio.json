  "about": "I’m an ambitious, multifaceted, and tenacious developer. I've been building experience since 2019, primarily front-end development (particularly iOS and web), but I’m also adventuring into backend work. I spent 7+ years working in radio, graphic design, and videography, where I picked up a wide range of skills. I'll be graduating from Ball State University in Fall 2023, sometime after which I'd like to work towards a CS Master's. I'm upbeat, straightforward, and love rock climbing.",
